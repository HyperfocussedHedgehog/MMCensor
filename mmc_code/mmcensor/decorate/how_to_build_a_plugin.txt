your plugin will be a single folder in this folder.

Take a look at the 'bar' folder for an example.

Your plugin must have an __init__.py that exports a class named decorator()

Your class must have the following functions:

* Initialize: this will be called once, when your class is added to the 
list of active decorators.  It will take a single argument, which is a 
list of all the classes you can expect to see.

* Decorate: this takes two arguments.  The first is an image, formatted
as a numpy array in (h,w,3) shape in BGR format (this is the format
used by OpenCV).  The second is a list of detected boxes.  Each box
is of the format
[
	timestamp, in nanoseconds
	class, a string, which will be an element of the known classes from the initialize function
	[ x1, y1, x2, y2 ], a list of four integers, which are the coordinates of the detected feature
]
This function must return a modified img in the same format

* export_settings: this function takes no arguments and must return a dictionary that will be saved as part of a JSON file.

* import_settings: this function takes a dictionary as an argument and must set up the decorator to the same settings as were saved in export_settings
