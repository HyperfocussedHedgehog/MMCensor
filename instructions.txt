0. If this is zip file is called MMC-vXY.zip, skip this step.  If this zip file is called
MMC-vYX-light.zip, it does not come with the NudeNet network weights (probably because it
is posted somewhere with a filesize limit below 25MB).  Download the weights file from
https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet/releases/download/v3.4-weights/640m.pt
If for some reason that link doesn't work, go to 
https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet
and look for the "pytorch link" for the "640m" model.
The file should be called 640m.pt and be approximately 50MB.  Put the file in the
"neuralnet_models" folder.

1. Double-click on setup.bat.  This will describe the five different neural net engines
that MMCensor can install for you.  1 is the fastest, and 5 is the slowest.  You should
select the fastest that is compatible with your hardware.  If for some reason it doesn't
work or you don't want to, you can always go DOWN the list to a slower version.

Go through the setup.bat process.  IT MAY TAKE A LONG TIME.  The tensorrt engine on my
computer takes fifteen minutes to install, and that's with a NVidia RTX 4090 and AMD 7950x.
On your machine it may take even longer.  If you don't see "press any key to continue",
the installer is still working.

This installer will also create a install-log-XXXXXXXX.txt file in your MMCensor folder,
which is helpful for debugging problems.  Don't delete it!

If at any point you get an error message about a "path" being "too long", you are running a
version of Windows that has a path limit of 260 characters.  I don't know why Windows does this,
sorry.  You can either edit your Windows Registry to remove the limit (as described here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/maximum-file-path-limitation?tabs=registry
which is an official Microsoft website), or you can try to move the MMCensor folder to
a very high-level folder (like C:/MMC/ instead of C:/users/mylongusername/Documents/faxes/2017/hidden/MMCensor).
You *definitely* need to reboot your computer if you do the registry change.

2. Once the setup is done, there will be a run-XXXXXXX.bat file created in the main MMCensor
folder, which you can double-click to launch MMCensor.  It will open a window with two tabs.
In Decorators, it will allow you to add and remove decorators, and configure them.  Choose
a type from the dropdown and use "add" to add it.  Use the "x" button to remove.  To change
options, click configure, and then "apply config" to apply your changes.  

In the "Realtime" tab, you can click "Make Ready" to warm up the neural net.  Once it is
ready, the "Start" button will be available.  You can choose which monitors or windows
you want to censor in the window (use the scroll wheel to scroll up or down).  You can 
select multiple windows, but selecting multiple windows has a SIGNIFICANT performance hit.
It is usually better to select a whole monitor rather than two windows on the monitor.
Use Start to start the censoring and Stop to stop it.  If you click Screenshot, it will
save a screenshot in the Screenshots/ folder in the MMC folder.  Refresh Window List 
refreshes the window list if you open new windows or close old ones.  FPS numbers will
be visible in the command window.

Sometimes the censoring overlay doesn't properly pop up.  I don't know why.  You can find 
it in your taskbar and click it to bring it up.

To end the program, simply use the X in the top-right of the control window.

Version 4.1 is not super hardened and resilient to error stuff yet so if anything weird happens,
try starting again.  I just wanted to release it to motivate myself to keep going.

If you have any issues, try to figure them out!  However, if you want help, you can ask me
on discord.  Please be sure to tell me
* EXACTLY, step by step, what you did (you can always entirely delete the MMCensor folder and
start from scratch from the zip file)
* The install-log-XXXXXXX.txt file for the engine you're trying to use
* Exactly what behavior you're seeing that isn't what you're expecting
* Any relevant output from the run-XXXXX.bat file
